Opinnd


Opinnd is one of my first attempts at building a Ruby on Rails application. Once built, the app will allow users to pin pictures to the app, with their descriptions (or opinions) about the pictures.

Note: Since GitHub repository creation, the name of this app has been changed to Opinnd from Opinned.
